# Changelog

## v3.11.0 — 2026-04-20

### Features
- `ocp update` now automatically syncs OpenClaw's registry with the latest models (scripts/sync-openclaw.mjs)
- Server logs warn if OpenClaw registry drifts from models.json

### Refactor
- models.json is now the single source of truth for model list
- server.mjs and setup.mjs derive MODEL_MAP/MODELS from models.json
- Adding a new model is now a one-file edit

### Fixes
- OpenClaw's model dropdown now shows all 4 current models (opus-4-7, opus-4-6, sonnet-4-6, haiku-4.5) on existing installs after `ocp update`. Previously setup.mjs only wrote the registry at install time.
